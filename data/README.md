This directory is where all the input data (demand profiles, building information, weather data, ... ) is placed. The data is not stored on Github. It must either be generated for a specific use case or a data sample can be requested from HSLU.

More info can be found on the documentation site: https://dem-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
